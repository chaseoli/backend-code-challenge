  // The data structure "{ [pokemonId]: pokemonId }" might seem odd, but this is a trick
  // for marking favorites at scale. Because it does not keep track
  // useless data (like false for un-favorite pokemon). Also makes it:
  //  - 1. helps prevent simultaneous write (async write) issues that could
  //    possibly result in data collision issues, especially when mongo is 
  //    distributed in the HA cluster.
  //    eg: when simultaneous writes occur to an array because it is the same array field
  //    that is being updated in parallel, therefore it is possible that the writes
  //    will collide resulting in inconsistent data unless handled properly
  //  - 2. an object is easier to work with in JS because we can simply 
  //    grab the object and convert to an array (using lodash) to iterate over, 
  //    this is ok we do not expect a list of favorites for a specific user
  //    to have to scale
  //  - 3. we can "dot off of" the object to
  //    make queries faster and more efficient
  //  Alternative ways to structure data include:
  //  - 1. we could have used { pokemonId: true | false }
  //    but this unnecessarily tracks false for non-favorite pokemon.
  //    Which unnecessarily increases the size of our data and ultimately
  //    impacts performance.
  //  - 2. we could have tracked favorites in an array. However, we would have had to 
  //    implement a processing pipeline to handle writes synchronously to prevent 
  //    data collision issues as described above. Also, in
  //    general are inefficient to query. And more inefficient to update
  //    since the query will have to iterate through the array to update it.
  //    In general, flattening the data structure and maintain an object like
  //    structure will scale better in the long run.
